# Sammlr
Python scripts to collect data from the Facebook API and calculate networks of page likes, mutually liked pages, user overlap, and content overlap

What you need before you can start:
- You will need to register as a Facebook developer to gain access to the Facebook Graph API (https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer) - from there, you can get the access token needed by the Sammlr application.
- You will also need the Facebook ID of the Facebook page you want to collect data fro. You can use pages like this (https://findmyfbid.com/) to find the numeric ID of a page.
- Sammlr is written in Python 3, so make sure you have a Python environment installed
